# Get Started as the Web Got Started

In this assignment, you will get a taste for making web pages, back in the days when the World Wide Web was terrible. Well, it wasn't terrible, it was just designed for academics, government officials, and folks working for the national defense. And what did these guys like? Boring stuff. To honnor them, we too will start with boring.

Tim Berners-Lee was and still is the legendary leader of the boring crew and is the actual inventor of the WWW. And it was recent enough, you can still visit it [here](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). It was made on August 6, 1991. Just before that, GRUNG music started in Seattle, and shortly after that, I started college in St. Paul, MN.

Since you know something about boring academic stuff, I want you to imagine you are writing a paper. Can be a History paper, or an English paper, but this is going to be a big one. It must have at least 3 sections and each of those section must have at least 2 sections in them. And of course you should have a title and an introduction and a conclusion and a bibliography (we will talk more about the bibliography later). It must be about a "real topic" such that the headlines are real, but the text itself can be Latin (if you ever want to seem smart, say it in Latin). You can auto generate your Latin, [here](https://loremipsum.io/).

To give you an example, as you know, we all have a ifs and buts in our lives. Maybe you want to write a paper on your big butt. The headlines would look something like this, but you will fill in paragrphs in Latin under each headline. At least 1 headline must have 3 latin paragraphs under it.

Title: My Big Butt

...a couple of sentences of intro text...

Why Big Butts are Important

* People like them
* Dogs love them

Other Sized Butts in History
* Did they exist
* Why did they exist
* Where can I get an extra one

Glutamus Maximus and Other Fun Words
* Wordle is fun
* That has nothing to do with Butts

Conclusion: 
blah, blah, blah, the end.

You will need to come up with your own topic, but it can be equally rediculous or it can be super serious. Ideally it will make you smile. You might think about images you will add later.

Once that is done, we will add TAGS! Tags will make this still boring, but much better.
